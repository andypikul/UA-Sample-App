Welcome to the Urban Airship client library for Android.

Add the library to your project using Android Studio
----------------------------------------------------
Include the `urbanairship-lib-x.x.x.aar` file as a dependency in the project.

1. Create a local ``aars`` directory with the library in the root of the your
project.

2. Modify the repositories section of the `build.gradle` file to look for the
local `aars` files:
    repositories {
        mavenCentral()

        flatDir {
            dirs 'aars'
        }
    }

3. Add the Urban Airship library, support v4, and Google Play Services as
dependencies:
    compile 'com.urbanairship:urbanairship-lib:+@aar'
    compile 'com.android.support:support-v4:20.+'
    compile 'com.google.android.gms:play-services:5.0.89'

4. Sync the project with the gradle file.

Add the library to your project using Eclipse
---------------------------------------------
The Urban Airship library needs to be added as a project with resources. Import
the "urbanairship-lib" project from the zip. Then include the project and the
v4 support library as a library dependency. More detailed steps for including
library projects with resources can are available in the Android Developer docs
http://developer.android.com/tools/projects/projects-eclipse.html#ReferencingLibraryProject
